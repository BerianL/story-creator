# JavaScript Basics Course Project: Variables and Strings Challenge

This project is a solution to the "Variables and Strings Challenge" in the JavaScript Basics course on Teamtreehouse.com. The challenge initially asked us to use the `prompt()` function for user inputs, but I opted to use the SweetAlert2 library and DaisyUI for a better user experience.

## Project Overview

The challenge is to create a JavaScript application that uses prompts to collect user inputs for different parts of a story and then generates a story based on those inputs. The application utilizes the SweetAlert2 library to display prompts and create a more interactive experience for users. DaisyUI is used for styling the webpage.

The core functionality of the application involves:

- Collecting user inputs using prompts for different story elements, such as animals, times of day, adjectives, and more.
- Dynamically generating a story template using the collected inputs, with placeholders for missing values.
- Displaying the generated story to the user on the webpage.

## Usage

1. Open your web browser and go to [https://berian.lowe.com/story-creator](https://berian.lowe.com/story-creator).
2. Click the "Start" button on the webpage to begin the story generation process.
3. Follow the prompts to input various words and elements.
4. Once all prompts are completed, the application will generate a unique story based on your inputs and display it on the webpage.

## Dependencies

- [SweetAlert2](https://sweetalert2.github.io/): A JavaScript library for creating attractive alerts and prompts.
- [DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com/): A CSS framework for styling web interfaces.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that contains the structure of the webpage.
- `styles.css`: CSS file for styling the webpage, including DaisyUI styles.
- `script.js`: JavaScript file containing the logic for collecting user inputs, generating the story, and displaying it on the webpage.
